This directory contains example scripts using PPIx::Regexp. Specifically:

README - is this file.

find-variable-length-lookarounds - is a script that examines Perl files
    looking for variable-length lookarounds.

interpolated - is a script that takes as its arguments a list of files
    and/or directories, and lists all Perl regular expressions which
    interpolate. If the -once option is asserted, only those expressions
    which interpolate and do not have the /o modifier are listed.

preaccepts - is a script that takes as its arguments a Perl regular
    expression and one or more Perl version numbers. For each Perl
    version number, it displays whether that version of Perl considers
    the regular expression to be valid.

predump - is a script that takes as its argument a regular expression,
    and dumps the parse tree. Various command options are available to
    control the dump. The -help option gets you complete documentation
    of the script.

prenav - is a script that takes as its single argument a regular
    expression.  The user can then interactively navigate around the
    parse tree. The 'help' command gives help.

preslurp - is a script that makes files into PPI::Document objects, then
    extracts the regular expression tokens from the documents and
    dumps them. Various command options are available to control the
    dump. The -help option gets you complete documentation of the
    script.
